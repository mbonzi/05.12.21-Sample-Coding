        If you were anything like me, when you graduated high school there were so many career fields that interested you that you could not pick just one.
        Not knowing exactly what I wanted to do, I enrolled in a community college in my local town while working two jobs simultaneously.
        I enrolled in courses for a math major, psychology major, fire, and EMT.
        If I didn't know what I wanted when I started undergraduate schooling, let me tell you that I was only getting for confused with every additional course that I enrolled in.
        By the time that I graduated, I had received two promotions, one at each job, and 4 Associates Degrees.
        I then transferred to a community college in Central California where I obtained one more degree within the next year, an AA-T in Kinesiology.
        This degree allowed my to transfer to California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo, California.
        After two years of working full-time and attending school full-time, I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Kinesiology.
        <br>
        <br>
        This degree propelled me towards my career in healthcare.
        Since graduating, I have worked at an orthopedic surgery clinic which utilizes my knowledge from school, personal training and experience from working at a physical therapy clinic.
        This career has increased my ability to lead a staff, work within a team environment, multitask, and maintain a clear thought-process while under pressure.
        What I did not expect to learn is that what I truly excelled at and enjoyed was organizing, editing, and entering data into our electronic medical record (EMR) systems.
        This part of the job is often described as <em>tedious but necessary</em>; however is what allowed me to finally make an informed decision on the future of my career.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong> I am very excited for my future in program development and coding!!</strong>
